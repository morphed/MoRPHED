{"name":"Morphed.github.io","tagline":"The MoRPHED Morphodynamic Model","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

{"name":"MoRPHED","tagline":"The MoRPHED morphodynamic model","body":"MoRPHED\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThe MoRPHED Morphodynamic Model. Some brief notes on building from source are here:\r\n\r\n1. MoRPHED has been successfully built on Windows 7 and 8. The software is written in Qt, and as such cross-platform building on Linux should also be possible, but may take some effort.\r\n\r\n2. We build MoRPHED using Qt with the MinGW compiler (g++; Qt 5.3.0, MinGW, 32 bit).\r\n\r\n3. MoRPHED leverages Geospatial Data Abstraction Libraries (GDAL) for geoprocessing routines. GDAL must be built from source; for directions see http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildingOnWindows and/or http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildHints.\r\n\r\n4. To build MoRPHED, select 'Release' mode and build \"MORPHED_GUI\". Once built, put a copy of libgdal-1.dll (obtained in Step 3) in MORPHED_GUTS/release.\r\n\r\n5. MoRPHED integrates with the freely-available Delft3D hydaulic model, which must be built by following the instructions at http://oss.deltares.nl/web/delft3d. When prompted in MoRPHED, provide the top-level directory of Delft (e.g. C:/delft3d).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
